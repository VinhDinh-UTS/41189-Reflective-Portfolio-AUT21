# My Reflective Portfolio

## Week 1 
1. Is everything a system?  Why or why not?
- Every **tangible thing** can be considered a system as, if nothing else, they are made up of elementary particles interacting with eachother, giving rise to its characteristics, qualifying it as a system.
- Not **everything** is a system as if we trace down the chain of elements as reductionists, there has to be a point at which a thing just **is**.

2. As we have defined complex systems would a passenger aircraft qualify as one?
- Although pedantic, a passenger aircraft does not qualify as a complex system. The operation of an aircraft does qualify as a complex system since it involves hundreds of humans and our behaviours.

3. Would the aircraft in question 2 qualify as a Complex Adaptive System?  Why or why not?
- The operation of the aircraft qualifies as a complex adaptive system. Many crises have been averted as a result of changes over the years in the flight crew's checklist (e.g. evacuation procedures, mishap response guide,...).

### What have I learnt this week? 
- The blurry line between types of systems, as well as around each one's boundary.

## Week 2 
1. What happens when the independence condition is not met?
- When the independence condition is not met, the person(s) with most influence in the "crowd" will impact the result of the group as a whole. This inevitably skews the result in the direction of the leader's opinion, however right or wrong that might be.

2. What if different models are telling me different things? What should I do?
- Try to figure out which specific models might be more applicable to the situation at hands (this may take lots and lots of experience). A relatively safe way would be to take the average of the results.

3. Do I need to learn lots of models? What happens when I am working on a team?
- You should learn at least a handful of models, know what they do, and when to use them.

### What have I learnt this week? 
- I learned that although I knew about the general thinking concepts and game theory, I did not actually know any model well enough to confidently apply them in real life.

## Week 3 
### What have I learnt this week? 
- I noticed the models that could be, and have been applied to machine learning (e.g. Decision Trees), and how the solution to avoid local optimum (considering different perspective) is eerily similar to the way computer scientists artificially increase variance in the neural network's decision.
- How a large portion of human centered systems can be modeled by assuming the stakeholders are rational, and act upon perceived incentives (thus explaining behavioural and rule-based actions). Although the result is never perfect, it is usually close.

## Week 4
### What have I learnt this week?
- Feedback loops are a useful tool to explain what had happened, although it can be heavily impacted by the hindsight effect.
- The formal definitions and maths of relationships that I knew existed, but did not know exactly.

## Week 5
### What have I learnt this week?
- I am lucky to have learnt statistics prior to this subject.
- That my auto-commit script failed to run.
- I should not be writing reflective portfolio for week 5 the night before week 6 workshop.
