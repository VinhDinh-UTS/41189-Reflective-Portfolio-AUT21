# My Reflective Portfolio

## Week 1 
1. Is everything a system?  Why or why not?
- Every **tangible thing** can be considered a system as, if nothing else, they are made up of elementary particles interacting with eachother, giving rise to its characteristics, qualifying it as a system.
- Not **everything** is a system as if we trace down the chain of elements as reductionists, there has to be a point at which a thing just **is**.

2. As we have defined complex systems would a passenger aircraft qualify as one?
- Although pedantic, a passenger aircraft does not qualify as a complex system. The operation of an aircraft does qualify as a complex system since it involves hundreds of humans and our behaviours.

3. Would the aircraft in question 2 qualify as a Complex Adaptive System?  Why or why not?
- The operation of the aircraft qualifies as a complex adaptive system. Many crises have been averted as a result of changes over the years in the flight crew's checklist (e.g. evacuation procedures, mishap response guide,...).

### What have I learnt this week? 
- The blurry line between types of systems, as well as around each one's boundary.

## Week 2 
1. What happens when the independence condition is not met?
- When the independence condition is not met, the person(s) with most influence in the "crowd" will impact the result of the group as a whole. This inevitably skews the result in the direction of the leader's opinion, however right or wrong that might be.

2. What if different models are telling me different things? What should I do?
- Try to figure out which specific models might be more applicable to the situation at hands (this may take lots and lots of experience). A relatively safe way would be to take the average of the results.

3. Do I need to learn lots of models? What happens when I am working on a team?
- You should learn at least a handful of models, know what they do, and when to use them.

### What have I learnt this week? 
- I learned that although I knew about the general thinking concepts and game theory, I did not actually know any model well enough to confidently apply them in real life.

## Week 3 
### What have I learnt this week? 
- I noticed the models that could be, and have been applied to machine learning (e.g. Decision Trees), and how the solution to avoid local optimum (considering different perspective) is eerily similar to the way computer scientists artificially increase variance in the neural network's decision.
- How a large portion of human centered systems can be modeled by assuming the stakeholders are rational, and act upon perceived incentives (thus explaining behavioural and rule-based actions). Although the result is never perfect, it is usually close.

## Week 4
### What have I learnt this week?
- Feedback loops are a useful tool to explain what had happened, although it can be heavily impacted by the hindsight effect.
- The formal definitions and maths of relationships that I knew existed, but did not know exactly.

## Week 5
### What have I learnt this week?
- I am lucky to have learnt statistics prior to this subject.
- That my auto-commit script failed to run.
- I should not be writing reflective portfolio for week 5 the night before week 6 workshop.

## Week 7
### What have I learnt this week?
- That even when I seemingly understand the concept, I still struggle to put it into the rigorous language that machines require, but when I eventually do, the satisfaction is hard to match.
- Working in a team requires a degree of acceptance, and understanding that the enemy of done is perfect.

## Week 8
### What have I learnt this week?
- I learnt that analyzing a system has always been a means to an end, and that whatever goal one has, they have to understand the system they operate in.

## Week 9
### What have I learnt this week?
- This week I dived into calculus after a long period of not thinking about it, and finally intuitively understand its purpose and applications.

## Week 10
- This week, I spent most of my studying time deliberating on which models to use in my final submission and not getting far.

## Week 11
- I finally decided on two systems that I want to develop, only to abandon both of them as the data I needed was not there. On the positive side, I think I now have a better understanding of group-based modelling and how highly successful individuals use them.

## Week 12
- We definitely took on more than we can handle, but I think we all came out of it better than when we started. Seeing the submission in its entirety, I may not be happy about the result, but I am proud of how we got there as a group.

#### Footnote
This practice is suprisingly helpful with consolidating my thoughts into words, and I think I should continue to do this on a personal level. I would probably forget about this in two weeks' time though.
